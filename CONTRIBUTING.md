## Contributing In General
Our project welcomes external contributions. If you have a contribution idea, feel free to hop in!

To contribute code or documentation, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/ThePrez/ServiceCommander-IBMi/pulls).

A good way to familiarize yourself with the codebase and contribution process is
to look for and tackle low-hanging fruit in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ThePrez/ServiceCommander-IBMi/issues).


### Proposing new features

If you would like to implement a new feature, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/ThePrez/ServiceCommander-IBMi/issues)
before sending a pull request so the feature can be discussed. This is to avoid
you wasting your valuable time working on a feature that the project developers
are not interested in accepting into the code base.


**Note: We appreciate your effort, and want to avoid a situation where a contribution
requires extensive rework (by you or by us), sits in backlog for a long time, or
cannot be accepted at all!**

### Fixing bugs

If you would like to fix a bug, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/ThePrez/ServiceCommander-IBMi/issues) before sending a
pull request so it can be tracked.


## Code Style

We highly appreciate if you conform to the code style that is consistent throughout the codebase. 

If you are an Eclipse user, you can simply use the code cleanup and formatter templates in the "eclipse" subdirectory
of the project.

If you are not an Eclipse user, we simply ask for best effort. Please make your branch editable by maintainers
when opening the pull request.

## Toolset
This project is built with Maven. Please ensure that your contribution can also be built with maven before submitting PRs
(for instance, by ensuring that pom.xml is updated with any dependencies).
